<p>
  You are given a sequence of intervals, as iterator of the iterators of ints.<br>
  It is your task to minimize the number of intervals by merging those that intersect or
  by removing intervals fitting into another one. After that you have to create an iterator object which is linked to this list.
</p>

<p>
  Since the range of values for the intervals is restricted to integers, you must also
  merge those intervals between which no value can be found.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>An example:</strong><br>
  Let's say you've got these 5 intervals: <em>1..6, 3..5, 7..10, 9..12 and 14..16</em>.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>1..6 and 3..5</em><br>
      <em>3..5</em> fits into <em>1..6</em>, so <em>3..5</em> must disappear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>1..6 and 7..10</em><br>
      Even though the intervals do not intersect, there can not be a value of type int
      between them, so they have to be merged to the new interval <em>1..10</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>1..10 and 9..12</em><br>
      These intervals do intersect, because <em>9 &lt; 10</em>,
      so they have to be merged to the new interval <em>1..12</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>1..12 and 14..16</em><br>
      These two intervals do not intersect, so they must not be merged.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>So the intervals to be returned are:</strong><br>
  <em>1..12 and 14..16</em>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Input:</strong>
  A sequence of intervals as an iterator of the iterators of 2 ints.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Output:</strong>
  The iterator object linked to the list of merged intervals.
